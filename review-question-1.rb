# How would you get the url for Bulbasaur's ability?
 pokemon.find {|character_hash| character_hash[:name] == "bulbasaur"}[:abilities].find {|ability_hash| ability_hash}[:ability][:url]


# How would you return the first pokemon with base experience over 40?

pokemon.find {|character_hash| character_hash[:base_experience] > 40}

# How would you return ALL OF THE pokemon with base experience over 40? (Gotta catch em all)
pokemon.select {|character_hash| character_hash[:base_experience] > 40}

# How would you return an array of all of the pokemon's names?
pokemon.collect {|character_hash| character_hash[:name]}

# How would you determine whether or not the pokemon array contained any pokemon with a weight greater than 60?
pokemon.any? {|character_hash| character_hash[:weight] > 60}

#  whatever method you use should return true if there are any such pokemon, false if not.
